				<h2>Facts About Childhood Literacy</h2>
				<p>
					It is critical to help young children be ready for school by working with them to develop early literacy and learning skills. Because strong reading skills form the basis for learning in all subjects, it is important to identify those who struggle with reading as early as possible. Children who have been read to at home come to school with important early literacy skills. They are prepared to learn to read and write. Children who have not had many experiences listening to books read aloud or talking about books typically start school with poor early literacy skills.  Find out how to to help your preschool child develop these essential early literacy skills.

					<li>Having books in the home is twice as important as the father's education level. <em>Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, 2010</em></li>
					<li>The single most significant factor influencing a child's early educational success is an introduction to books and being read to at home prior to beginning school. <em>National Commission on Reading, 1985</em></li>
					<li>The only behavior measure that correlates significantly with reading scores is the number of books in the home. <em>The Literacy Crisis: False Claims, Real Solutions, 1998.</em></li>

				<h2>Oregon Kindergarten Readiness</h2>
				<p>
					The Oregon Kindergarten Assessment was created to get a clearer picture of early learning experiences across the state, and to add to the information teachers and schools acquire in order to better understand the needs of their students related to interpersonal skills, selfregulation, and early literacy and math skills. For literacy schools, the test measures a child's ability to recognize letters (both upper and lower case) and to know what sound those letters represent. Oregon has been testing kindergarten readiness for the last 3 years and finds that on average, an Oregon kindergartner starts the school year knowing less than 20% of their letter names and less than 10% of the letter sounds.

				<p>
					The good news is that there is a lot that we as parents can do to help set our children up for success.
